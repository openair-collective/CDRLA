AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation law in relation to enacting the carbon dioxide removal leadership act

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as the “carbon dioxide removal leadership act”.

[The legislative findings are largely a copy/paste from the CLCPA with some modifications specific to CDR - we can opt to remove or revise]
Section 2. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature hereby finds and declares that:

1.  Climate change is adversely affecting economic well-being, public health, natural resources, and the environment of New York. The adverse impacts of climate change include:
a. an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as storms, flooding, and heat waves, which can cause direct injury or death, property damage, and ecological damage  (e.g.,  through the release of hazardous substances into the environment);

b. rising sea levels, which exacerbate damage from storm surges and flooding, contribute to coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion, and inundate low-lying areas, leading to the displacement of or damage to coastal habitat, property, and infrastructure; 

c. a decline in freshwater and saltwater fish populations;

d. increased average temperatures, which increase the demand  for  air conditioning and refrigeration among residents and businesses;

e. exacerbation of air pollution; and

f. an increase in the incidences of infectious diseases, asthma attacks, heart attacks, and other  negative health outcomes. These impacts are having a detrimental effect on some of New York’s largest industries, including agriculture, commercial shipping, forestry,  tourism, and  recreational and commercial fishing. These impacts also place additional strain on the physical infrastructure that delivers critical services to the citizens of New York, including the state’s energy, transportation, stormwater, and wastewater infrastructure.

2. a. The severity of current climate change and the threat of additional and more severe change will be affected by the actions undertaken by New York and other jurisdictions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)  and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will be required by mid-century in order to limit global warming to no more than 2°C and ideally 1.5°C, and thus minimize the risk of severe impacts from climate change. Specifically, industrialized countries must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by at  least 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to stabilize carbon dioxide equivalent concentrations at 450 parts per million - the level required to stay within the 2°C target.

b. On December 12, 2015, one hundred ninety-five countries at the 21st Conference of the parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted an agreement addressing greenhouse gas emissions mitigation,  adaptation, and finance starting in the year 2020, known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement was adopted on November  4, 2016, and is the largest concerted global effort to combat climate change to date.

3. Action undertaken by New York to reduce greenhouse emissions will have an impact on global greenhouse gas emissions and the rate of climate change. In addition, such action will encourage other jurisdictions to implement complementary greenhouse gas reduction strategies and provide an example of how such strategies can be implemented. It will also advance the development of green technologies and sustainable practices within the private sector, which can  have far-reaching  impacts such as a reduction in the cost of renewable energy components, and  the creation of jobs and tax revenues in New York.

4. Although substantial emissions reductions are necessary to avoid the most severe impacts of  climate change, complementary adaptation measures will also be needed to address those risks that cannot be avoided. Some of the impacts of climate change are already observable in New York state and the northeastern United States.  Annual average temperatures are on the rise, winter snow cover is decreasing, heat waves and precipitation are  intensifying, and sea levels along New York’s coastline are approximately one foot higher than they were in 1900.  New York has also experienced an increasing number of extreme and unusual weather events, like Hurricanes Irene and Lee, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, which caused at least 53 deaths and $32 billion in damage in New York state, and localized storms which have caused flooding of roadways and mass transit.

5. Consistent with the goal of the state of New York to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all anthropogenic sources 100% over 1990 levels by the year 2050, with an incremental target of at least a 40% reduction in climate pollution by the year 2030, in line with USGCRP and IPCC projections of what is necessary to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, New York passed the climate leadership and community protection act (CLCPA) in 2019.

6. Notwithstanding the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions anticipated by the requirements of the CLCPA, certain legacy emissions will not be capable of being fully eliminated and must be offset through the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for utilization or long-term sequestration. [consider adding more CDR statistics here]

7. Climate change especially heightens the vulnerability of disadvantaged communities, which bear environmental and socioeconomic burdens as well as legacies of racial and ethnic discrimination. Actions undertaken by New York state to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions should prioritize the safety, health and economic equality of disadvantaged communities by incentivizing the carbon dioxide removal industries to invest in these areas.

8. Creating good jobs and a thriving economy is a core concern of New York state.  The carbon dioxide removal economy will continue to grow and be an important source of high-quality good-paying jobs.

9. Ensuring carbon dioxide removal career opportunities are created and shared geographically and demographically is necessary to ensure increased access to good jobs for disadvantaged communities while making the same neighborhoods more resilient.  Climate change has a disproportionate impact on low-income people, women, and workers.  It is in the interest of the state of New York to protect and promote the interests of these groups in efforts to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
